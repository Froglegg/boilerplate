        <h3 style="color:red;">SPAM is DELICIOUS</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most confounding anti-spam rhetoric is leveled at its flavor, which is unqiue, delicate, hearty, savory, and sweet. These characteristics, which the masses are willfully ignorant of, are why SPAM was once commonplace in the American kitchen. However, George Soros and Hilary Clinton (and let's not forget OBAMA) have worked together over the decades with their reptilian overlords in a smear campaign that rivals the staged moon landing or Pizzagate cover-up in terms of complexity and harm.</p>

<h3 style="color:#ccc;">SPAM is CHEAP</h3>
<p>While SPAM is very affordable to buy in single packet or can form at the local American grocer, the author suggests you contact Hormel directly and order Spam in bulk for greatest affordablilty. See <a href="https://www.thriftyfun.com/tf475703.tip.html">this link</a> for more information on how to order SPAM in bulk.</p>

    Sinbad is 1,023 years old and credits his great vitality and magical abilities to eating SPAM every meal since he was but a babe. SPAM rivals tiger's eye and bear bile in terms of life-giving magical powers.
